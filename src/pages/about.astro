          I'm a Senior Software Engineering Manager based in Seattle, currently leading teams at Gainsight.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey in tech has taken me through startups and growth-stage companies, most recently at
          Skilljar—a Seattle-based learning management platform—which was acquired by Gainsight in 2025.
          Before that, I helped build products at Efficient Era Corporation.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white pt-4">What I Do</h2>
        <p>
          I lead engineering teams building software products that help companies succeed. My work spans
          full-stack development, cloud infrastructure, and the people side of engineering—mentoring
          developers, shaping technical strategy, and creating environments where teams can do their best work.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm passionate about building useful things on the web and enjoy working across the entire stack,
          from React frontends to cloud infrastructure on AWS.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white pt-4">Background</h2>
        <p>
          I studied at the University of Minnesota and have called Seattle home for several years now.
          When I'm not writing code or leading teams, you might find me exploring the Pacific Northwest
          or practicing my French.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white pt-4">Get in Touch</h2>
