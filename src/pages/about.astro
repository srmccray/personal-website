          I'm a Software Engineering Manager based in Seattle, currently leading teams at Gainsight.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey in tech has taken me through startups and growth-stage companies, most recently at
          Skilljar—a Seattle-based learning management platform—which was acquired by Gainsight in 2025.
          Before that, I helped build products at Efficient Era, where we created tools to help
          businesses sell on Amazon.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white pt-4">What I Do</h2>
        <p>
          I lead engineering teams building software products that help companies succeed. My work spans
          full-stack development, cloud infrastructure, and the people side of engineering—mentoring
          developers, shaping technical strategy, and creating environments where teams can do their best work.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm passionate about building useful things on the web and enjoy working across the entire stack,
          from React frontends to cloud infrastructure on AWS.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white pt-4">Background</h2>
        <p>
          I studied at the University of Minnesota and now live on Whidbey Island in the Pacific Northwest.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white pt-4">Outside of Work</h2>
        <p>
          When I'm not leading teams, you'll probably find me walking my dog Cosmo around the island.
        </p>

            alt="Cosmo the dog"
            class="rounded-xl border border-border object-cover aspect-square"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          I'm also a big fan of tabletop games. I play Magic: The Gathering—Canadian Highlander is my
          current format of choice—and love board games like Dune Imperium and Sherlock Holmes
          Consulting Detective.
        </p>
